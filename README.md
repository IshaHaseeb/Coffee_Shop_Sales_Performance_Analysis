## Coffee_Shop_Sales_Performance_Analysis
In the competitive landscape of the coffee shop industry, understanding sales performance is crucial for driving growth and improving operational efficiency. This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a coffee shop chain with three locations during the first half of 2023. The objective is to evaluate key metrics such as overall revenue, transaction counts, product performance, and customer behavior insights. To achieve this, we will utilize SQL queries and a PostgreSQL database to extract and analyze data related to sales transactions.

In our revenue analysis by store, we assessed the financial performance of each location to determine which one is driving the most sales. This analysis involved examining both revenue and transaction counts, enabling us to identify the most profitable stores and make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and promotional strategies. Notably, Hell's Kitchen emerged as the top performer, generating the highest revenue, with coffee recognized as its best-selling product.

To gain further insights into product performance, we focused on identifying the top 10 best-selling products based on transaction quantity and revenue. Our key findings revealed that Earl Grey tea was the top seller, with 4,708 units sold and generating $11,770 in revenue, while dark chocolate closely followed with 4,668 units sold, bringing in $21,006 in revenue. This information underscores the products that resonate most with customers, facilitating better inventory management and targeted promotional efforts.

Additionally, we analyzed revenue by product category to understand which categories contribute the most to overall sales. The results highlighted that coffee was the highest revenue-generating category, totaling $269,952.45, followed by tea at $196,405.95. This insight emphasizes the significance of these categories in our product lineup, suggesting an opportunity to expand offerings in these areas. Finally, we conducted time-based analyses to understand transaction patterns, revealing peak sales hours between 8 AM and 10 AM, as well as the highest transaction volume occurring on Saturdays. These insights can be instrumental in optimizing staffing and inventory management.
